## Current negotiations in UK

Jisc is currently negotiating on behalf of UK for a 'transformative'
arrangement.  This does not seem like a good deal, as it reinforces a
lock-in.  Jisc are undoubtedly in a difficult position, negotiating on
behalf of all UK institutions, with different needs and demands for
journals.  The result of the 2016 negotiations was widely regarded as
a poor deal for research-intensive institutions.  Jisc also seemingly
failed on several of their own targets for a deal.




## Alternatives to a big deal

Saying no to any deal, and relying on Interlibrary Loans.  Most German institutions
have been without a deal for about 2 years.

Buying individual journals rather than a bundle.  Several institutions
in the US have selected a subset of journals and paid for them
individually.  This can save significant amounts (about 1 million
dollars in one case, for ???).  See also [Thornton and Brundy
